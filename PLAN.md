# Project Plan: Yaplon Enhancements

This document outlines the plan for enhancing the Yaplon project.

## 1. Initial Setup and Scaffolding (Current)
    - Create `PLAN.md` (this file) to track overall project goals and steps.
    - Create `TODO.md` to list specific tasks and track their status.
    - Create `CHANGELOG.md` to document all significant changes made to the project.

## 2. Codebase Review and Refinement
    - **Thoroughly review the existing codebase:**
        - Analyze `yaplon/reader.py`, `yaplon/writer.py`, `yaplon/__main__.py`.
        - Analyze format-specific modules: `yaplon/ojson.py`, `yaplon/oplist.py`, `yaplon/oyaml.py`.
        - Analyze comment stripping utilities: `yaplon/file_strip/`.
    - **Identify areas for improvement:**
        - Code elegance and readability.
        - Efficiency and performance.
        - Error handling and robustness.
        - Consistency in data handling across formats.
        - Test coverage and quality.
    - **Update `TODO.md`** with specific tasks identified during the review.

## 3. Feature Implementation and Bug Fixing (Iterative)
    - Address items from `TODO.md`. This may include:
        - Refactoring shared logic to reduce redundancy.
        - Improving CLI argument parsing and help messages.
        - Enhancing type conversion logic (e.g., more robust date/binary handling).
        - Adding new conversion paths or options if deemed necessary.
        - Fixing any identified bugs.
    - For each significant change:
        - Write or update unit tests.
        - Ensure all tests pass.
        - Document the change in `CHANGELOG.md`.
        - Update `TODO.md` and this `PLAN.md` as needed.

## 4. Documentation and Build Process
    - **Review and update `README.md`:**
        - Ensure all CLI commands and options are accurately documented.
        - Clarify usage examples.
    - **Verify build and packaging files:**
        - `setup.py`: Check dependencies, entry points, classifiers.
        - `requirements.txt`: Ensure it's in sync.
        - `Makefile`: Confirm build, test, lint, and format commands are working.
        - `dist.sh`: Review the release process script.
    - **Improve inline documentation:** Add/update docstrings and comments where necessary.

## 5. Final Review and Submission
    - Conduct a comprehensive review of all changes.
    - Ensure all tests pass.
    - Ensure all documentation is up-to-date.
    - Run `npx repomix -o ./llms.txt .` to update the codebase snapshot.
    - Submit the final changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
